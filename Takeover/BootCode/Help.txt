Hi there.

I've got bit of problem. :-(
Basically Hired Guns ain't working on the CDTV from floppy.

Its works fine with the HD installed version (being OS friendly),
but as soon as I kiss exec goodbye then those damn level 2
interrupts keep on comin'.

At the moment I've bodged a fix. A custom bootblock that
dismounts CD0 from the expansion.library mountlist.

This seems to works fine. The only snag is that I can't search
for the "CD0" name explicitly. The dn_Name entry of the device
node structure looks like it contains a pointer to a BSTR name
but it doesn't (or at least I think it doesn't). At the moment
the code just removes whatever volume is at the end of the
mountlist whuch just happens to be CD0 on the CDTV, but this is
not very 'nice', can anyone help?

(Jolyon's cdon/off code in the flist works fine but takes up too
much space. Yes my disks ARE that full. Value for money or what!)

I'll binmail the code, smakes and all for any kind souls perusal.
:-)

Thanks in advance,

    Scott J.
